I'm using ShowPaletteMacro in my ViewTemplate to display a palettes with a colour swatch. Look at some <<tag palette>>s to see how it looks. The colour swatches update automatically if you edit the colours. Try it and see.

As well as that there is an "apply" button in the toolbar which uses a macro from SelectPaletteMacro to apply that palette's colour scheme.

SelectPaletteMacro also provides a drop-down selector for palettes. It looks like this:
<<selectPalette>>
