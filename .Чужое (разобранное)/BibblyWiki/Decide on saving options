In the right-hand Interface options panel, there are several options with check boxes beside them, and two of them are {{{SaveBackups}}} and {{{AutoSave}}}. When {{{SaveBackups}}} is checked, TiddlyWiki automatically makes an entire backup copy of itself in the folder where it is located or in a folder designated by you in AdvancedOptions whenever changes are saved.  When {{{AutoSave}}} is checked, TiddlyWiki saves changes immediately after they are made.

Below is a chart on the pros and cons of checking and unchecking these items.
