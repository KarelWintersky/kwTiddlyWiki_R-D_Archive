To do math, type it in single backticks (on the tilde key). Most things work as you might expect:
`int_a^b (3/x) dx  =  sqrt(49)*[(1, 3),(2, x^2)]`
is actually {{{`int_a^b (3/x) dx  =  sqrt(49)*[(1, 3),(2, x^2)]`}}}

If you do not see any math, make sure you are using Firefox. If you do not see everything correctly, make sure to load the fonts via
